          How to Fix a Roof Leak in Brooklyn
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
          Roof leaks are one of the most common problems homeowners face in
          Brooklyn. With heavy rain, snow, and aging flat roofs, small issues
          can quickly turn into costly damage.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          1. Identify the Source of the Leak
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Look for water stains on ceilings, peeling paint, or mold growth.
          Most Brooklyn homes have flat or low-slope roofs, which makes pooling
          water a common issue.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          2. Inspect Flashing and Seams
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Damaged flashing around chimneys and vents is often the cause of roof
          leaks. Cracked seams in membrane roofing systems can also allow water
          to penetrate.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          3. Temporary Fix vs. Professional Repair
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          While roofing sealants can temporarily stop small leaks, professional
          repair ensures long-term protection. Ignoring the problem may lead to
          structural damage.
